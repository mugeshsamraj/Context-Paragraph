  `It was a concerning development that he couldn't get out of his mind. 
  He'd had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with 
  them, but he couldn't understand how it had all stopped. There was some point as he grew 
  up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time, and he had no idea 
  that it would be the last. `,
`Spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure, 
but this wasn't the type of excitement she was hoping to experience. 
As she contemplated the situation she found herself in, she knew she'd gotten herself

a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal.`,
`The amber droplet hung from the branch, reaching fullness and ready to drop. It waited. 
While many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release, 
this droplet had other plans. It wanted to be part of history. It wanted to be remembered

she woke, she realized she was once again at a crossroads. Would it be another excuse or 
would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream? Dana rose and took her first step. `,
`It seemed like it should have been so simple. There was nothing inherently difficult with 
getting the project done. It was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should 
have been able to complete it on time, but that wasnt the case. The deadline had arrived 
and the project remained unfinished. ` ,
`There are different types of secrets. She had held onto plenty of them during her life, 
but this one was different. She found herself holding onto the worst type. It was the type 
of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didn't tell someone about it, but it 
could end up getting you killed if you did.`,
`She glanced up into the sky to watch the clouds taking shape. First, she saw a dog. Next,

pour. `,
